                 README: PC-386/486/Pentium[234]/iacsflP[23]

This file contains board-specific information for a generic PC-386/486/
Pentium[234]/iacsflP[23] target board.  
This file documents BSP interface changes from previous
software or hardware versions, and notifies the user of serious caveats
that must be noted before using this BSP.  Additionally, the target
board's reference entry (e.g., man pcXXXX for UNIX or the HTML reference
entries) provides board-specific information necessary to run VxWorks.
The target reference entry should be read fully before this BSP is used.
